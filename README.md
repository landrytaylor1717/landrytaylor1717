I’m a Texas A&M student who enjoys building small web apps, backend services, and experimenting with quantitative & machine learning code. Below are a few highlighted projects and an overview of technologies I work with.

## 🔭 About me

- Location: Texas A&M University
- Currently: Student; learning more about ML, backend development, and full‑stack web apps

## ⚡ Quant & Machine Learning — my focus

- I'm aiming to become a quantitative researcher/quant — I focus on quantitative experiments, backtesting, data pipelines, and model prototyping.
- Primary project: [Quant-JuliaCode-MachineLearning](https://github.com/landrytaylor1717/Quant-JuliaCode-MachineLearning) — experiments in Julia and Python for quantitative analysis and ML. This is my main area of work and where I showcase research and prototypes.
- Neural network experiments: [Neural-Network-Repo (replace with actual repo name)](https://github.com/landrytaylor1717/Neural-Network-Repo) — placeholder link. Reply with the repo name (or let me fetch it) and I'll update this to the correct URL and a short summary.

## ⭐️ Featured projects
 - [Quant-JuliaCode-MachineLearning](https://github.com/landrytaylor1717/Quant-JuliaCode-MachineLearning) — quantitative/ML experiments (Julia / mixed languages)
 - [BSMNeuralNetwork](https://github.com/joeyjpaul23/BSMNeuralNetwork) — neural network experiments (collaboration with @joeyjpaul23)
 - [sports-rules-backend](https://github.com/landrytaylor1717/sports-rules-backend) — archived backend project / JavaScript
 - [Polymarket-Kalshi-Arbitrage-Model](https://github.com/landrytaylor1717/Polymarket-Kalshi-Arbitrage-Model) — quick arbitrage model and exploration (fun experiment)
